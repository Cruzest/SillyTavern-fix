# SillyTavern-1.9.7-fix
Latest from SillyTavern with Poe integration. This version only adds the Poe connection achieved by GlizzyChief to SillyTavern version 1.9.7. This is a prototype and will be updated as bugs arise with the integration.

## How to install
Just follow the steps for the GlizzyChief version, only changing the git clone to this version:

git clone https://github.com/LegendPoet/SillyTavern-1.9.7-fix.git

From then on, you don't need any additional implementation. The original GlizzyChief project here: https://github.com/GlizzyChief/SillyTavern-1.8.4-fix

## It works the same as version 1.8.4?
More or less. Basically this is the reintegration of the Poe options, this time using the GlizzyChief API for the connection.

## Credits
All credits go to the SillyTavern team for their great work and continued support and improvements to the interface, as well as GlizzyChief, vfnm and ITSNOTPOEVER, who allow us to continue enjoying Poe with SillyTavern. Thanks guys!
