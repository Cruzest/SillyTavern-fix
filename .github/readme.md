# SillyTavern-1.10.1-fix
Latest from SillyTavern with Poe integration. This version only adds the Poe connection achieved by GlizzyChief to SillyTavern version 1.10.1. This is a prototype and will be updated as bugs arise with the integration.

Update only if you need the latest SillyTavern improvements or want to support this new integration by providing feedback and reporting bugs. Otherwise, I recommend sticking with version 1.9.7-fix(now stable).

## How to install
Just follow exactly the steps in the version of GlizzyChief. You don't need any additional implementation.
GlizzyChief's original project here: https://github.com/GlizzyChief/SillyTavern-1.8.4-fix

## It works the same as version 1.8.4?
More or less. Basically this is the reintegration of the Poe options, this time using the GlizzyChief API for the connection.

## Credits
All credits go to the SillyTavern team for their great work and continued support and improvements to the interface, as well as GlizzyChief, vfnm and ITSNOTPOEVER, who allow us to continue enjoying Poe with SillyTavern. Thanks guys!
